Kotlin TornadoFx Grid Constraints Bug(Feature) Demo
====================================================

Seems like some properties of `gridpaneConstraints` doesn't work:

```
columnRowIndex(?, ?)
rowIndex = ?
columnIndex = ?
```

Update: OK, that's not really bugs. They just can't work with `row`. The demo is updated.

Open `Hello.kt` in your IDE, and see the gui and code.
